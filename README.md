## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**MarquinDJCoder/MarquinDJCoder** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Legal Assistant
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front-End and trying to learn Python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the Digital Law field and Development of Legal Digital Tools
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Full-stack and Data Analysis
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Disco Elysium or Geopolitics, who knows what is about to come?
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Be silly, but not too weird. Be direct, I have autism, so I don't understand subjectivity
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My familly call me as "Highlander" sometimes, because I've survived many accidents.
