## Hi there 👋

**MarquinDJCoder/MarquinDJCoder** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a **Legal Assistant**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End and trying to learn Python
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the Digital Law field and Development of Legal Digital Tools
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Full-stack and Data Analysis
- 💬 Ask me about Disco Elysium or Geopolitics, who knows what is about to come?
- 📫 How to reach me: Be silly, but not too weird. Be direct, I have autism, so I don't understand subjectivity
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My familly call me as "Highlander" sometimes, because I've survived many accidents.
